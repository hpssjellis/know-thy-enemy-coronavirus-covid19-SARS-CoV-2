# Who am I

My name is Jeremy Ellis, I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry, along with other Degrees and Diplomas. I have taught Physics, Math, Science and through constant Professional Development I am self-taught at Animation (Blender), 3D Printing, [https://github.com/hpssjellis/arduino-high-school-robotics-course](Robotics) and lately [Machine Learning (Deep Learning using tensorflowjs)](http://rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs). These self taught skills I am now teaching courses on full time. I have the skill of being able to simplify complex topics in an understandable format for most people. I am now turning my attention to Covid-19. I expect no-one to read this page, the point of this study is to try to understand this Pandemic at a local, human point of view, and see if I can simplify some of the confusing points.

## Science

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

What this means is that science is constantly building, it is not an endpoint. Predictions are based on past observations and knowledge and are then tested for new knowledge. The world has never had a Pandemic caused by the exact SARS-CoV-2 virus, so the science about Covid-19 presently is a bunch of predictions that need to be tested. 

## Politics

Also from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics](Wiki) Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country, state or area. It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members[1] and achieving and exercising positions of governanceâ€”organized control over a human community.


## Pandemic

Unfortunately when we put Politics together with Science about a topic that has not specifically been tested we are going to have issues.

The best anyone can do is keep an open mind about how to proceed and constantly update your knowledge based on new science as it become available.

## Street Level WebCams

I have made a specific file that has Street Level Webcams so you can see what other places around the world are doing to battle covid19

[StreetCams.md](StreetCams.md)  This is a work in progress! PR's welcome
