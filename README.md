# Who am I

My name is Jeremy Ellis, I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry, along with other Degrees and Diplomas. I have taught Physics, Math, Science and through constant Professional Development am self-taught at Animation (Blender), 3D Printing, Robotics and lately Machine Learning (Deep Learning using tensorflowjs). These self taught skills I am now teaching courses full time. I have the skill of being able to simplify complex topics and am now turning my attention to Covid-19. I expect no-one to read this page, the point of this study is to try to understand this Pandemic at a local, human point of view, and see if I can simplify some of the confusing points.

# Science

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
