# Who am I

My name is Jeremy Ellis, I have a B.Sc. in Chemistry, along with other Degrees and Diplomas. I have taught Physics, Math, Science and through constant Professional Development I am self-taught at Animation (Blender), 3D Printing, [https://github.com/hpssjellis/arduino-high-school-robotics-course](Robotics) and lately [Machine Learning (Deep Learning using tensorflowjs)](http://rocksetta.com/tensorflowjs). These self taught skills I am now teaching courses on full time. I have the skill of being able to simplify complex topics in an understandable format for most people. I am now turning my attention to Covid-19. I expect no-one to read this page, the point of this study is to try to understand this Pandemic at a local, human point of view, and see if I can simplify some of the confusing points.

## Science

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

What this means is that science is constantly building, it is not an endpoint. Predictions are based on past observations and knowledge and are then tested for new knowledge. The world has never had a Pandemic caused by the exact SARS-CoV-2 virus, so the science about Covid-19 presently is a bunch of predictions that need to be tested. 

## Politics

Also from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics](Wiki) Politics is the set of activities that are associated with the governance of a country, state or area. It involves making decisions that apply to groups of members[1] and achieving and exercising positions of governanceâ€”organized control over a human community.


## Pandemic

Unfortunately when we put Politics together with Science about a topic that has not specifically been tested we are going to have issues.

The best anyone can do is keep an open mind about how to proceed and constantly update your knowledge based on new science as it become available.

# What does Science Know about the Disease Covid-19 and the Virus SARS-CoV-2. Specifically how to stop it from replicating!

Temperature, ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, pH changes and salt can play a role in weakening a viral envelope.

"The dryer air may also allow the virus to stay airborne longer and increase the chance of another person coming in contact through inhalation," says Bilsky. This has to do with respiratory droplet formations. In dry air, the droplets remain smaller and lighter, allowing them to spread further. However, in more humid conditions, droplets can be larger and heavier, making them fall to the ground faster.

## My Thoughts. 

Masks have 2 effects. 1. Source Control a huge effect as even homemade masks can reduce the expulsion of virus laden droplets BEFORE they evaporate into very small droplete (or areosols). Once the droplets have evaporated to a smaller size it is very difficult for homemade masks to effectively filter the smallest droplets.

2. Filter effect. It is generally understood that thin layer homemade masks have limited filtering ability for all but the largest virus laden droplets, sugical masks are better and N95 Respirator masks are the best that are inexpesively available. Also generally acceptaded that the N95 masks are saved for hospital workers who are potentially in environments with artificially created areosols of the virus which is much more dangerous that the typical out of hospital environment.




### Homemade masks

These are my views alone with out any medical base.
Reminder: Stay at home, if you can't stay at home social distance, if you can't social distance, wear a mask.

Three types of Masks:

1. Source Control Masks: any material wrapped around the face that slightly filters exhaled breath, cough and sneeze is helpful in reducing the reproducibility of the virus. Obviously some masks will be better, but ALL masks have a reduction effect! As such it is very important to breath out into the filter. If the filter only covers your mouth then you must breath out of your mouth. Since source control is strictly about helping to protect others fromyour potential of having Covid-19 theoretically you could breath in through your un-protected nose getting fresh air as long as you breath out through the filtering mask.

2. Foo Filter (FU Filter) Mask: This is a filter that is made to protect you but has no interest in protecting others. Made from multiple layers of filter material in an attempt at making a filter that is as capable if not better than a surgical mask, but probably still not as good as an N95 respirator. The Foo Filter can be made using various materials including coffee filters, felt (oil absorbing) paper towel and layering of the layers. This type of filter might be difficult to breath through if too many layers are used. Very important to breath through the filter but could exhale any way. Such as breathing through your filtered mouth but exhaling through the unfiltered nose. A benefit of this mask is that it can be hand held and placed for those short period of times when you can't social distance, such as the few seconds riding an elevator, etc. reaplying this mask opens you up for contamenation from the mask, especially if the outside is reversed. This mask can be easily made as a coffee filter puch with other filters inside it.

3. Combined Homemade Mask: A combination of the above 2 filters, has source control for protecting others and FU Filter layered filter approach for increasing personal protection, (while making air intake more difficult). Suggest a full nose mouth mask such as a buff instead of a simple mask as the combined approach is susceptable to leaks with the increased breathing difficulty.
